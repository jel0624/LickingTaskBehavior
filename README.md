# LickingTaskBehavior
This is a repository for the Arduino based lateralized licking task. We adapted a headfixed lateralized licking task, inspired from [*Guo, et al (2013)*](http://google.com). We use auditory tones instead of pole position, and we do not implement a delay period so mice can lick as soon as they hear the tones.
Here is a simple schematic of the task (adapted from *Lee, et al, 2020*):
