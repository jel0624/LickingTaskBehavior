# LickingTaskBehavior
This is a repository for the Arduino based lateralized licking task. We adapted a headfixed lateralized licking task, inspired from [*Guo, et al (2013)*](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(13)00924-0?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627313009240%3Fshowall%3Dtrue). We use auditory tones instead of pole position, and we do not implement a delay period so mice can lick as soon as they hear the tones.
Here is a simple schematic of the task (adapted from *Lee, et al, 2020*):
