# Tapered Fiber GUI

This is a MATLAB script that will create a GUI allowing control over a tapered fiber launch system (*Lee et al, 2020*). The GUI is designed to trigger laser pulses when receiving a digital ON signal, coming from e.g. Arduino (see LickingTaskBehavior/AdruinoCodes). Given specific needs/hardware requirements for each experiment, we suggest you use your version of the code/software to trigger the laser.
